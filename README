This code is written purely for my own benefit with the intention of reviewing
basic algorithms and C syntax for tech interviews. The code and algorithms
ought to work as advertised and with the expected asymptotic performance (or I
probably won't get hired :) ), but it would be foolish to use any of this code
for anything real.
